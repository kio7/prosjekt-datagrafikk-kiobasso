Step 1: Start Button
    The machine is initiated by pressing a start button or lever.

Step 2: Release the Pendulum
    The start button releases a swinging pendulum.

Step 3: Pendulum Strikes Dominos
    The swinging pendulum strikes a row of dominos, causing them to fall.

Step 4: Dominos Knock Over a Ball
    The falling dominos push a ball down a ramp.

Step 5: Rolling Ball Hits a Seesaw
    The rolling ball hits a seesaw, causing it to tilt.

Step 6: Seesaw Activates Conveyor Belt
    As the seesaw tilts, it triggers a conveyor belt to start moving.

Step 7: Conveyor Belt Moves an Object
    The conveyor belt moves an object to a designated location.

Step 8: Object Drops Onto a Spring
    The object on the conveyor belt drops onto a spring.

Step 9: Spring Compresses and Releases
    The spring compresses as the object lands on it and then releases, launching the object into the air.

Step 10: Object Strikes Rotating Gears
    The launched object hits a set of rotating gears.

Step 11: Rotating Gears Transfer Motion
    The rotating gears transfer motion to a connected platform or lever.

Step 12: Platform Moves, Activating a Lever
    The platform or lever is pushed or pulled by the rotating gears, causing it to move.

Step 13: Lever Activates a Switch
    The moving lever activates a switch, completing an electrical circuit.

Step 14: Electromagnet is Energized
    The completed circuit energizes an electromagnet.

Step 15: Electromagnet Releases a Trap Door
    The energized electromagnet releases a trap door.

Step 16: Trap Door Drops an Object
    The trap door drops an object onto a final path.

Step 17: Object Rolls Toward a Target
    The object rolls down the final path towards a target.

Step 18: Object Strikes the End Goal
    The object strikes a target or trigger, indicating the successful completion of the Rube Goldberg machine.
